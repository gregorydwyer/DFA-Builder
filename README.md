# Deterministic Finite Automata Builder
This program simulates a deterministic finite automata. The DFA can be built from a file (formatted line the 2 test files) or be manually input using the prompts. The program will then display the alphabet and ask for an input string to test. After testing the output shows if the string is accepted in the language or not.
